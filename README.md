# The-Corinthians-Gazette
This is my first project made after just an image as an idea, I found the photo on Google.
It's something simple which contains a navbar and some divs with multiple strcutures of news sections. It has multiple components for each option in the navbar.
The part that I am most proud of is the mobile version for which I created a hamburger menu out of three divs that will also transform in the closing X icon.
